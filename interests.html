      <h5><u>Machine Learning</u></h5>
      <p><b>Machine learning</b> is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that
        computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying
        on patterns and inference instead. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine
        learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as "training data",
        in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the
        task. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as
        email filtering and computer vision, where it is difficult or infeasible to develop a
        conventional algorithm for effectively performing the task. <br>Machine learning is a method
        of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial
        intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make
        decisions with minimal human intervention.</p>

      <h5><u>Computational Neuroscience</u></h5>
      <p><b>Computational neuroscience</b> is a branch of neuroscience which uses computational approaches, to study the nervous system.
         Computational approaches include mathematics, statistics, computer simulations, and abstractions which are used across many
         subareas of neuroscience including development, structure, physiology and cognitive abilities of the nervous system.
         <br>Computational neuroscience is the only field that can help you understand, how you’re able to think and process information
         in your brain. Even by the time you finished this sentence, there will be a good number of actions happening inside your
         brain which can be decoded by the study of neurons. The ultimate goal of computational neuroscience is to explain how
         electrical and chemical signals are used in the brain to represent and process information. It explains the biophysical
         mechanisms of computation in neurons, computer simulations of neural circuits, and models of learning.</p>

      <h5><u>Artificial Intelligence</u></h5>
      <p><b>Artificial intelligence (AI)</b> is wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart
        machines capable of performing tasks the typically require human intelligence. AI is an interdisciplinary
        science with multiple approaches, but advancements in machine learning and deep learning are creating a
        paradigm shift in virtually every sector of the tech industry. Artificial Intelligence can fall usually
        two broad categories: Narrow AI and Artificial General Intelligence.<br><b>Narrow AI</b> is all around us and
        is easily the most successful realization of artificial intelligence to date. With its focus on performing
        specific tasks. Some examples would be Google Search, image recognition software, and Siri, to name a few.
      <br><b>Artificial general intelligence (AGI)</b> is the intelligence of a machine that can understand or learn any
        intellectual task that a human being can. It is a primary goal of some artificial intelligence research
        and a common topic in science fiction and futures studies. AGI can also be referred to as strong AI,
        full AI, or general intelligent action </p>

      <h5><u>Artificial Intelligence</u></h5>
      <p><b>Data mining</b> is the process of finding anomalies, patterns and correlations within large data sets
        to predict outcomes. Using a broad range of techniques, you can use this information to increase revenues,
        cut costs, improve customer relationships, reduce risks and more.<br><b>Data mining</b> is the exploration and
        analysis of large data to discover meaningful patterns and rules. It’s considered a discipline under the
        data science field of study and differs from predictive analytics because it describes historical data,
        while data mining aims to predict future outcomes. Additionally, data mining techniques are used to build
        machine learning (ML) models that power modern artificial intelligence (AI) applications such as search
        engine algorithms and recommendation systems.</p>
